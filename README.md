To install and run the system, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```

2. Open the solution file (AtmManagementSystem.sln) in Visual Studio or another C# IDE.
3. Modify or replace the connection string in the AppStarter file to yours after creating your database.
